# Mastodon Design
A prototype repo for [Mastodon iOS](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-ios/pulls) designs. 

## Usage

* To run the sample project, open `Design.xcodeproj` in the latest version of Xcode and run the **Design** app in the simulator.
* SWiftUI Previews are also available in the Xcode Canvas.

## Prototype

The code in this repository is prototype-quality. While some of it may be useful in production, it’s meant to be an inspiration for implementation rather than a strict guide on how to implement the design. Pay particular attention to accessibility, spacing, animation,and color usage, as those are things we’re trying to demonstrate by writing SwiftUI.
